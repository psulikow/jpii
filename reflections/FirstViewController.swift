There is a difference between the usage of the term \"blessed\" as pertaining to Mary and its usage as pertaining to a beatified person. \"Blessed\" as a Marian title refers to her exalted state as being the greatest among the saints; for a person who has been declared beatified, on the other hand, \"blessed\" simply indicates that they may be venerated despite not being officially canonized. Catholic teachings make clear that Mary is not considered divine and prayers to her are not answered by her, but rather by God through her intercession.

Given that this practice had an unorthodox air, he was brought before Pope Martin V, who instead of rebuking Bernardine, encouraged the practice and joined a procession for it in Rome. The devotion to the Holy Name became so popular in Italy that the IHS trigram was often inscribed over the doorways of houses. The tablet used by Bernardine is now venerated at the basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome.\n\nThe Litany of the Holy Name is an old and popular form of prayer in honor of the Name of Jesus.
